### 🚀 About Me

Hi there! I'm Bahunur — a computer engineer passionate about **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **large language models (LLMs)**.  
Currently, I'm working at MTA (General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration) where I develop AI-powered solutions for public-sector and scientific projects.

With a solid academic foundation (MSc from the University of Sussex) and full-stack development experience in .NET Core and MERN,  
I bridge the gap between theory and implementation.
